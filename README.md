# Emotion-Aware Speech Generation with Integrated Text Analysis

This repository contains the code and experiments for the final year project in Computer Science, focusing on Emotion-Aware Speech Generation with Integrated Text Analysis using emotion embeddings from a RoBERTa model. It includes various Natural Language Processing (NLP) experiments performed during an NLP course, as well as a modified version of an existing text-to-speech synthesis codebase.

## Project Overview

The project aims to generate emotion-aware speech using a modified text-to-speech synthesis system. By integrating emotion embeddings from a RoBERTa model, the generated speech output exhibits the desired emotions as specified by the input text.

## Repository Structure

- `FYP_Notebooks/`: Contains various notebooks for different experiments and data processing methods
- `FastSpeech2_Text_Aware_Emotion_TTS/`: Contains the modified text-to-speech synthesis codebase for emotion-aware speech generation.
- `Transformers_for_NLP/`: Contains various NLP experiments conducted during the Data Science: Transformers for Natural Language Processing course.
- `Utils/`: Contains the code for processing and preparing the data for training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run the experiments and use the Emotion-Aware Speech Generation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ionut-cmd/FYP.git`
2. Navigate to the `FastSpeech2_Text_Aware_Emotion_TTS/` directory.
3. Follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the `FastSpeech2_Text_Aware_Emotion_TTS/README.md` file.

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on the [ming024/FastSpeech2](https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2.git) for text-to-speech synthesis. I would like to thank the original author for their work, which served as a starting point for this project.
